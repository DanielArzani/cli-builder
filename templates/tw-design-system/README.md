# Design Systems

This is the basic setup for a frontend mentor design system using tailwind

To use, `npm install` then just run `npm run build` or `npm run watch`

\*\*Note: Don't forget to add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{path}/develop/css/main.css" />` to your html files in the layouts folder!
